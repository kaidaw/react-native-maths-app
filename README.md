  <p>
  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few aspects of my experience building this application: <br/>
  
  1: This was my first experience using React Native so a lot of the time I spent on this project was researching
  how to use this framework. I am very pleased with how well I did for my first attempt! Although for future projects
  I would definitely spend more time implementing things like typescript (I completely ignored this for this project,
  as I wanted to focus more on the core functionality of the app rather than spending too long making it perfect and
  running out of time; I like to build first and refine after). <br/>
  
  2: I was able to test this project only on my own iPhone, so unfortunately I cannot be 100% sure that it works equally well
  using android. This is a limitation of the timeframe I was able to develop this project within. <br/>

  </P>
